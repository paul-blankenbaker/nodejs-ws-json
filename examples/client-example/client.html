    <h1>Example Client for JSON WebSocket Server</h1>

    <p>This page is used to experiment and test the JSON WebSocket
      server interface. Make sure the server is configured and running
      and that you know the URL to connect to.</p>
    <div id="tool"></div>

    <h1>JSON Messages</h1>
    <p>
      Messages sent across the web socket connection will always be in
      a JSON format and each message will contain a single JSON object
      having at least an <em>op</em> attribute to uniquely identify
      the operation to be performed.  Other than the <em>op</em>
      attribute to identify the action, all other attributes are
      dependent upon the action being requested. The recognized
      message types are described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>NOTE</b>: If authentication is enabled, you will need to
      perform the <em>authenticate</em> action prior to any other
      operation.
    </p>

    <h2>authenticate: Authenticate (after connection)</h2>

    <div class="summary">
Request:
<pre class="jsonMsg">{
  "op": "authenticate",
  "key": "UNIQUE_KEY"
}</pre></div>
Response:
<pre class="jsonMsg">{
  "op": "authenticate",
  "authenticated": true
}</pre></div>
  <div class="description">
    If the service has been configured with authentication enabled,
    you MUST post this message after your initial connection to
    authenticate yourself before you will be permitted to perform any
    other operations. At a minimum, you will receive a response with
    the <em>authenticated</em> attribute set to <em>true</em>. If
    authentication is not enabled, you may receive this on your
    initial connect. Once received, you should NOT attempt to
    authenticate yourself again. Failure or invalid authentication
    attempts will result in the closing of your connection.

      This message is used to start a new process on the server. You
      must specify the <em>cmd</em>, <em>args</em> (can be empty
      array), and <em>options</em> (can be empty object). If you want
      text output, you must specify an <em>encoding</em> type (like
      "utf-8", but it can depend on the command you are
      running). Refer to
      the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html">child_process.spawn</a>
      document for details on the <em>options</em>.

      <p>After starting a new process, expect several different types of <em>exec</em> messages coming back.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>"state": "started"</dt>
        <dd>This message is returned letting you know that the process
        has been started at the server. It will include the process ID
        (<em>pid</em>) tied to the process.</dd>
        <dt>"state": "out" and "state": "err"</dt>
        <dd>These messages occur as the running process writes data to
        stdout (<em>out</em>) and stderr (<em>err</em>). These
        messages will include the process ID (<em>pid</em>) of the
        process that generated the output. The output value will
        appear as a string (<em>text</em>) if an <em>encoding</em>
        value was specified when the process was started. If
        an <em>encoding</em> value was not specified, you will get the
        raw binary data (<em>bytes</em>) to play with.</dd>
        <dt>"state": "exit"</dt>
        <dd>This message is returned once the process terminates. It
        will always include the process ID (<em>pid</em>) as the
        original paramters used to start the process
        (<em>startedBy</em>). It will also include a <em>code</em>
        and <em>signal</em> attribute, however at least one of them
        will be <em>null</em>. The <em>code</em> attribute will be an
        integer value based on the process exit code if the process
        ended normally. The <em>signal</em> will be a string
        indicating the signal that killed the process if the process
        was terminated by a signal instead of a normal exit.</dd>
        <dt>"state": "error"</dt>
        <dd>This message is returned if an abnormal situation occurs
        when starting the process. For example, if you tried to
        execute something that was not on the system. You will not get
        a process ID in the response as the process did not start. You
        will get a system error message (<em>message</em>) and the
        original command that attempted to start the process
        (<em>startedBy</em>).</dd>
